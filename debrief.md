## Improvements

### 1. Code Quality and Readability
- Refactor external API requests from HubSpot
- Provide an encapsulation to retry requests
- Provide readable and descriptive names. For example, the 'q' and 'data' variables can be renamed to 'actionQueue' and 'contacts', 'companies', or 'meetings' respectively.

### 2. Project Architecture
- Separate code into sections (concerns) comprising of API Layer, Data Processing, and Error Handling so that it is easy, for example, to write unit tests for the logic of data processing and easily mock API requests.
- Type Checking with TypeScript, especially since the program does a lot of data aggregation, TypeScript would offer consistency, reducing regression errors. It would also offer greater readability and ease of coding.
- Move constants like 'limit' and 'maxRetries' to a config file or at least declare them as constant variables.

### 3. Code Performance
- Parallelize multiple API requests where possible to reduce latency and avoid unnecessary requests using `Promise.all` if it is supported by the API.
- Use efficient data structures like Sets to remove duplicates and Maps or objects as dictionaries to provide quick lookups.
- Properly handle pagination instead of just resetting 'offsetObject.after' to 0.
- While fetching associated contacts, implement the dictionary also as a cache for contacts when subsequent pages of meeting engagements are fetched.
